## Game Strategy Tips

### When to Fold (Pre-Flop/Flop/Turn only)
- Weak hole cards with low base award potential (e.g., no pairs, low cards)
- After Flop if you have High Card with no draw potential
- Saves chips AND returns your turn (can try again)
- Remember: Folding costs $20 blind but doesn't consume a turn

### When to Call/Check
- You have a decent hand (pair or better) with positive expected value
- Drawing to a flush or straight with potential for good payout
- At River phase (only option besides folding earlier)
- Minimal pot investment needed to see showdown

### When to Raise (Pre-Flop/Flop/Turn only)
- Strong hand with high base award (Flush, Full House, Four of a Kind, etc.)
- High confidence in getting a paying hand
- Want to maximize magnification for bigger payout
- Each raise costs $20 and increases magnification by 1×
- Strategic raising: Flush (King high) at 3× = 265 × 3 = $795 vs 1× = $265

### Payout Math Strategy
- **Base payout**: hand_rank × magnification
- **Break-even analysis** (examples with $20 blind):
  - One Pair (Aces) at 1×: 28 × 1 = $28 (profit $8)
  - One Pair (Aces) at 3× (raised twice): 28 × 3 = $84 (profit $24 after $60 in raises)
  - Three of a Kind (Queens) at 2×: 60 × 2 = $120 (profit $80)
  - Flush (King high) at 1×: 265 × 1 = $265 (profit $245!)
  - Full House (Aces over Kings) at 1×: 535 × 1 = $535 (profit $515!)
  - Four of a Kind (Jacks) at 1×: 1044 × 1 = $1,044 (profit $1,024!)
  - Royal Flush at 1×: 10000 × 1 = $10,000 (massive profit!)
- **Goal**: High-value hands are extremely profitable even at 1× magnification
- **Risk management**: Raising increases payout but costs $20 each time

### Risk vs Reward
- Each hand costs $20 (big blind) minimum
- **Bankruptcy risk**: Running out of chips ends the game immediately - you lose!
- Folding returns turn but loses blind investment
- Raising costs $20 and increases magnification by 1×
- **Critical threshold**: If chips drop below blind amount, game over
- High Card = minimal payout (2-14 only)
- One Pair/Two Pair = small payouts but now profitable at 1× ($28-$54)
- Three of a Kind+ = very profitable ($30-$70 at 1×)
- Flush/Straight = highly profitable ($150-$265 at 1×)
- Full House/Four of a Kind/Straight Flush = extremely profitable ($500-$5,000+ at 1×)
- Royal Flush = instant massive win ($10,000 at 1×)
- Balance conservative and aggressive play across 5 turns
- **Chip management is critical**: Don't risk going broke before completing 5 turns
