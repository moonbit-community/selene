## Game Strategy Tips

### When to Fold (Pre-Flop/Flop/Turn only)
- Weak hole cards with low base award potential (e.g., no pairs, low cards)
- After Flop if you have High Card with no draw potential
- Saves chips AND returns your turn (can try again)
- Remember: Folding costs $20 blind but doesn't consume a turn

### When to Call/Check
- You have a decent hand (pair or better) with positive expected value
- Drawing to a flush or straight with potential for good payout
- At River phase (only option besides folding earlier)
- Minimal pot investment needed to see showdown

### When to Raise (Pre-Flop/Flop/Turn only)
- Strong hand with high base award (Flush, Full House, Four of a Kind, etc.)
- High confidence in getting a paying hand
- Want to maximize magnification for bigger payout
- Each raise costs $20 and increases magnification by 1×
- Strategic raising: Flush (King high) at 3× = 365 × 3 = $1,095 vs 1× = $365

### Payout Math Strategy
- **Base payout**: hand_rank × magnification
- **Break-even analysis** (examples with $20 blind):
  - One Pair (Aces) at 1×: (15 + 14 × 2) × 1 = 43 × 1 = $43 (profit $23)
  - One Pair (Aces) at 3× (raised twice): 43 × 3 = $129 (profit $49 after $80 total cost)
  - Three of a Kind (Queens) at 2×: (120 + 13 × 3) × 2 = 159 × 2 = $318 (profit $278!)
  - Flush (King high) at 1×: (300 + 13 × 5) × 1 = 365 × 1 = $365 (profit $345!)
  - Full House (Aces over Kings) at 1×: (500 + 14 × 3 + 13 × 2) × 1 = 568 × 1 = $568 (profit $548!)
  - Four of a Kind (Jacks) at 1×: (2000 + 11 × 4) × 1 = 2044 × 1 = $2,044 (profit $2,024!)
  - Royal Flush at 1×: 20000 × 1 = $20,000 (massive profit!)
- **Goal**: High-value hands are extremely profitable even at 1× magnification
- **Risk management**: Raising increases payout but costs $20 each time

### Risk vs Reward
- Each hand costs $20 (big blind) minimum
- **Bankruptcy risk**: Running out of chips ends the game immediately - you lose!
- Folding returns turn but loses blind investment
- Raising costs $20 and increases magnification by 1×
- **Critical threshold**: If chips drop below blind amount, game over
- High Card = minimal payout (2-14 only)
- One Pair = now profitable at 1× ($17-$43 base)
- Two Pair = good payout ($54-$106 base)
- Three of a Kind = very profitable ($126-$162 base)
- Straight/Flush = highly profitable ($270-$365 base)
- Full House/Four of a Kind = extremely profitable ($568-$2,056 base)
- Straight Flush = huge win ($8,070-$8,140 base)
- Royal Flush = instant massive win ($20,000 at 1×)
- Balance conservative and aggressive play across 10 turns
- **Chip management is critical**: Don't risk going broke before completing 10 turns
